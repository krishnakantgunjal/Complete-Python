# ðŸ§© 1) File Read & Write â€“ Word Frequency Counter
# Task:
# Write a program that:
# Reads a file named notes.txt
# Counts how many times each word appears (ignore case)
# Writes the word-frequency report to a new file called report.txt
# Example Input (notes.txt):
# Python is easy to learn. Python is powerful.
# Expected Output (report.txt):
# python : 2
# is : 2
# easy : 1
# to : 1
# learn : 1
# powerful : 1
# (Hint: use .lower(), .split(), and a dictionary.)
